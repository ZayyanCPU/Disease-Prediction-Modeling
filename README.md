## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Overview**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Handling Missing Values**: 
     - Utilized `SimpleImputer` for imputation (mean/median strategy).
   - **Feature Scaling**: 
     - **Standardization** of numerical features using **StandardScaler**.
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: 
     - Used **One-Hot Encoding** to convert categorical variables into numerical format.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Correlation Matrix**: 
     - Heatmaps for understanding feature relationships.
   - **Visualizations**: 
     - Pair plots and histograms to identify patterns and distribution.

### 3. **Machine Learning Models**
| **Model**                | **Type**             | **Use Case**                         |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Logistic Regression**   | Linear Classifier    | Binary classification (Heart Disease, Stroke) |
| **Na√Øve Bayes**           | Probabilistic Model  | Best for independent features        |
| **Decision Trees**        | Tree-based Model     | Classifies data based on feature splits |
| **Random Forest**         | Ensemble Learning    | Multiple decision trees for higher accuracy |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors**   | Instance-based       | Classifies based on nearest neighbors |
| **Support Vector Machines**| High-dimensional     | Best for complex datasets with many features |

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
   - **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: Assesses the ability of the model to differentiate between classes.
   - **Cross-validation**: Ensures model stability across data subsets.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insight into the number of correct and incorrect classifications.

### 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - **Grid Search**: Exhaustively tests all hyperparameter combinations for the best performance.
   - **Random Search**: Efficient search method that randomly selects a subset of hyperparameters.
