# Machine Learning Lab Project: Disease Prediction and Classification

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict and classify various diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, asthma, kidney disease, and skin cancer. The project focuses on leveraging healthcare datasets to build robust models capable of early disease diagnosis based on medical and demographic factors. Multiple machine learning algorithms have been tested to identify the most effective ones for disease prediction.

## Objective
The primary goal is to develop a classification model capable of predicting multiple diseases based on medical and demographic factors. This project utilizes supervised learning techniques, such as Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to train and evaluate the models. The objective is to provide a model that can predict diseases accurately and aid healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.

## Technical Overview
The project involves the following core steps and techniques:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Handling Missing Values**: SimpleImputer is used to fill missing values in the dataset using strategies like mean or median imputation.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Standardization of numerical features ensures that all features are on the same scale, improving the model's efficiency and performance. This is crucial for algorithms like KNN and SVM.
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical data (e.g., gender or disease history) is encoded into numerical format using techniques like One-Hot Encoding to make it compatible with machine learning models.
   
### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Correlation Matrix**: A heatmap of feature correlations helps identify the strength of relationships between different variables and target disease conditions.
   - **Visualizations**: Graphs like pair plots and histograms are used to understand feature distributions and detect patterns that could help in model selection and feature engineering.
   
### 3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - **Logistic Regression**: A linear model used for binary classification, suitable for diseases like heart disease and stroke.
   - **Naïve Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, useful when the features are conditionally independent.
   - **Decision Trees**: A tree-based model that splits the data into smaller subsets to classify instances based on feature values.
   - **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines predictions from multiple decision trees for more stable and accurate results.
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm that classifies data based on the majority vote of its neighbors.
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful algorithm for high-dimensional classification tasks, particularly effective in complex datasets.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - **Accuracy**: Used as the primary metric for evaluating model performance. It represents the proportion of correct predictions.
   - **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: A more detailed metric for evaluating models' ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes.
   - **Cross-validation**: Used to ensure that the model performs consistently across different subsets of the data, minimizing overfitting.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a summary of prediction results, helping to evaluate how well the model is classifying each class.

### 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - **Grid Search**: This technique is used to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the models. It exhaustively tests all combinations of parameters to find the most optimal configuration.
   - **Random Search**: A more efficient search method where a random subset of hyperparameters is tested, speeding up the tuning process.

### 6. **Final Model Selection**:
   - Based on evaluation metrics, the model that performs best on the target disease categories is selected. Logistic Regression and Random Forest were found to perform well for different diseases in the dataset.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Correlation analysis and feature visualization to identify key predictors.
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrix.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use of GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters for better performance.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Collect patient attributes relevant for disease classification, including features like age, sex, BMI, medical history, and more.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, normalizing or scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most important features influencing disease prediction based on exploratory analysis and correlation.
4. **Model Training**: Train different machine learning models using the selected features and labeled data.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to fine-tune the model's parameters.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models based on their accuracy and AUC to assess their performance.
7. **Final Model Selection**: Choose the model that performs the best on the target disease categories for deployment.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to disease prediction and classification. While Logistic Regression and Random Forest provided strong performances across various diseases, further improvements in data quality, feature selection, and addressing class imbalance could enhance model generalization and accuracy. In the future, adding more features such as patient lifestyle and behavioral data, and integrating unstructured data like health records or imaging, could further improve the performance.

## Future Work and Enhancements
1. **Improving the Dataset Quality**: 
   - **Handling Missing Data**: Ensure better handling of missing values, including exploring advanced imputation methods.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Develop additional features such as interaction terms between key variables (e.g., BMI * Age Category).
   
2. **Addressing Class Imbalance**: 
   - Implement techniques like oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling to balance the dataset and improve model performance, particularly for diseases with a high imbalance between positive and negative cases.

3. **Expanding the Dataset**: 
   - Include multimodal data, such as unstructured textual information from electronic health records or imaging data, which could help improve prediction accuracy.

4. **Exploring Deep Learning**: 
   - Although this project uses traditional machine learning algorithms, exploring deep learning models (e.g., neural networks) may further enhance prediction accuracy, especially for complex relationships between features.
